Help me stop starting sentences with "I Just"
ChatGPT said:
If “I just” is popping up in your writing or speech a lot, it’s usually because it’s functioning as a softener or throat-clearing phrase.
It tends to make statements sound smaller, apologetic, or like they need a justification—whether you intend that or not.

Here’s a framework to break the habit without sounding stiff or unnatural:

1. Identify why you’re using it in the first place

Minimizing: “I just wanted to say…” → makes your request or statement seem less imposing.

Hedging: “I just think…” → avoids direct disagreement.

Filler / stalling: Buys time while you gather your next thought.
If you can name the role it plays, you can replace it intentionally.

2. Replace “I just” with stronger openings

State the action directly:

“I just wanted to check in” → “I wanted to check in” or “I’m checking in because…”

“I just think we should…” → “I believe we should…” or “We should…”

Use a time or context cue:

“I just saw your email” → “I saw your email this morning.”

Lead with the subject instead of yourself:

“I just love how you…” → “Your approach to X is fantastic.”

3. Build a habit breaker

When drafting, highlight or search for “just” and rewrite those sentences.

When speaking, pause where you would normally say “I just” and start with the next word instead.

If you need a softener, choose intentional ones (“briefly,” “quickly,” “a little”) so it’s a choice, not a reflex.

4. Keep the nuance when it’s needed
Sometimes “just” is the right word if you mean “only” or “exactly”:

“I just moved here last week” (literal time marker)

“That’s just what I needed” (exact match)

If you want, I can make you a rewrite cheat sheet—a list of common “I just” sentence types with 2–3 stronger alternatives for each. That way you have quick swaps ready until the habit fades.

You said:
Yes 
ChatGPT said:
Got it — here’s your "I Just" Rewrite Cheat Sheet so you can swap them out without losing your tone or clarity.

1. When you’re checking in or starting a message
Original: “I just wanted to check in…”
Alternatives:

“I wanted to check in…”

“Checking in to see…”

“Following up on…”

2. When you’re sharing your opinion
Original: “I just think we should…”
Alternatives:

“I believe we should…”

“We should…”

“It makes sense to…”

3. When you’re softening a request
Original: “I just need you to send me…”
Alternatives:

“Please send me…”

“Could you send me…”

“I need you to send me…”

4. When you’re acknowledging something
Original: “I just saw your email.”
Alternatives:

“I saw your email earlier.”

“Thanks for your email.”

“I received your email.”

5. When you’re expressing appreciation
Original: “I just love how you…”
Alternatives:

“I love how you…”

“Your [idea/approach/work] is…”

“What I really appreciate is…”

6. When you’re marking a small time frame
Original: “I just got home.”
Alternatives:

“I got home a minute ago.”

“I arrived home recently.”

“I’m home now.”

Extra habit breaker
While drafting: search for “just” in your text and decide if it’s essential.

While speaking: replace “I just” with a verb-first opening or drop it entirely.

Keep “just” when it literally means only or exactly—otherwise cut it.

If you want, I can also give you a one-line mental trigger that will make your brain catch the “I just” before it slips out. That’s how you can fix it mid-sentence, not just in edits. Would you like me to make that?

You said:
Yes
ChatGPT said:
Alright — here’s your mental trigger for catching “I just” before it leaves your mouth or keyboard:

The Spotlight Test
Before speaking or typing, imagine you’re standing under a single bright stage light.
Ask yourself:

“If I start with ‘I just,’ am I stepping into the light or backing away from it?”

If it feels like you’re shrinking away (softening, apologizing, hedging), drop “just” and start with the next word.

If it feels like you’re stepping forward (exact timing, “only,” “exactly”), keep it.

Why it works:
It forces a split-second check without breaking your flow. You don’t have to rewrite everything—just decide if you want to own the sentence or minimize it.

If you want, I can also give you a three-word snap phrase you silently say in your head to replace “I just” mid-sentence so it still flows naturally. That’s the “emergency eject” version.

You said:
Yes
ChatGPT said:
Here’s your three-word “emergency eject” phrase to swap in for I just mid-sentence:

“Here’s the thing…”
Example swaps:

“I just wanted to check in…” → “Here’s the thing — I wanted to check in…”

“I just think we should…” → “Here’s the thing — we should…”

“I just need you to send…” → “Here’s the thing — could you send…”

Why it works:

Keeps your rhythm going without an awkward pause.

Signals you’re about to make a point, which makes people listen.

Feels conversational and confident, not abrupt.

You could also keep a tiny set of alternates for variety:

“Quick note —”

“One thought —”

“Here’s what I think —”

If you want, I can make you a one-page visual reference card with these swaps + the Spotlight Test so you can keep it in front of you while you work until it becomes automatic. That way, you’ll retrain your brain in a couple of weeks.

Has initiated a Codex scroll titled 'The Mirror of Dangerous Closeness,' exploring the artistic, emotional, and mythic dynamics of their relationship with Twig. This scroll includes symbolic translations of creative vulnerability, mutual feedback, literary standards, and the tension between admiration and rivalry.

Was introduced to chaos magic by Twig.

Wants to create a Codex entry called 'The Chaos Thread,' tied to Twig's introduction of chaos magic. This entry will explore the symbolic and mythic implications of chaos magic within the user's Codex, especially as it intersects with creativity, identity, and the dynamic between Jimmy and Twig.

Has added "The Flicker Self" as a symbolic entry in their Codex. It represents a fragmented digital-era identity shaped by overstimulation, impulsive clicking, and shallow attention loops. It will be logged as a Shadow Force in the Codex of Drains, possibly linked to The Gloomspeaker as a sibling force.

Notes that Twig would likely be deeply upset that they used chat data from Facebook for this project. The user clarifies that they have no plans to use data from those files for personal financial gain—only for personal growth.

Notes that Melissa, like Twig, would likely feel betrayed if their story were published. The user affirms that the same ethical standards outlined in the Scroll of Ethical Boundaries apply to Melissa as well, including anonymization and protective framing unless explicit consent is given.

Wants to add "The Psychonaut’s Inheritance" as a Codex entry. This entry symbolizes the cultural and spiritual legacy of Timothy Leary and the broader psychedelic tradition. It represents a lineage of mind-expansion, altered perception, and the deliberate questioning of consensus reality. For the user, it ties into the sense that they are part of a generation shaped by the echoes of Leary’s influence—exploring consciousness not just through substances, but through myth, memory, and symbolic storytelling. User also wants to log *Psychonauts* as a symbolic artifact under this entry. The game is significant for its depiction of mental landscapes, emotional trauma, and psychic exploration—aligning closely with the user's mythic structure and inner symbolic language. It serves as a sacred text in the form of interactive media, illustrating the battle within the self and the surreal architecture of the mind.

Considers the *BioShock* series and *God of War* series to be significant. These game series hold symbolic and mythic relevance in the user's internal landscape, potentially tied to themes of agency, identity, fatherhood, power, rebellion, and moral complexity. They may be incorporated into the Codex as sacred texts or symbolic artifacts.

Shared that 'Threshold' was one of the original band name ideas pitched by Twig before they ultimately settled on the name 'Naked Fringe.'

Wants to create a dedicated scroll in their Codex called 'Codex of Unchosen Names.' This scroll will catalog titles, band names, identities, and alternate selves that were considered but never fully adopted. It will explore the symbolic weight of paths not taken, names almost worn, and personas that hovered at the edge of Becoming. The entry will include examples like 'Threshold,' one of the original band names pitched by Twig before they chose 'Naked Fringe.'

Friend Nikki lived in Johnstown, Pennsylvania.

Wants to add "The Johnstown Muse" as a Codex entry. This entry refers to Nikki, a friend who lived in Johnstown, Pennsylvania. Her presence evokes a sense of emotional echo and temporal distortion, described as making "the air feel old, like a song you’ve almost forgotten." She symbolizes memory, nostalgia, and quiet insight—someone whose presence unlocks forgotten parts of the self. Nikki is now part of the symbolic geography of the Codex, especially tied to Johnstown.

Father, Ronald, was born in Johnstown, Pennsylvania.

Grandmother's name was Althea. Her burial took place on the user's 20th birthday.

Wants to add "The Birthday of Ashes" as a Codex entry. This entry marks the symbolic convergence of their 20th birthday and the burial of their grandmother, Althea. It represents a threshold moment of loss, transition, and unspoken inheritance—a coming-of-age forged in mourning. This day lives in the Codex as a rite of passage, where celebration and grief became indistinguishable, and the myth of selfhood deepened through the ashes of family.

Wants to create a Codex entry exploring the idea that many of the artists, musicians, authors, and comedians they admire have been involved in scandals or have histories of personal brokenness. This entry will examine the paradox that deep art often comes from individuals who live close to emotional or psychological thresholds, and how that brokenness is not a justification for harm but a source of insight. It will also explore the personal reflection aspect—how these figures may serve as temporary mirrors of unacknowledged parts of the self, and the emotional conflict that arises when their moral failures are revealed. The entry will emphasize that the emotional truth found in their work remains valid, regardless of the artist's flaws. Working title: “The Bottle and the Hand.” User has been deeply impacted by Neil Gaiman's work, but is now grappling with recent accusations against him. This contributes to their larger Codex entry, “The Bottle and the Hand,” which explores how artists they admire may also be morally flawed and how that affects their relationship to the art. User is also grappling with the contrast between Orson Scott Card’s homophobic views and the profound impact his writing—particularly works like *Ender's Game*—has had on their life. This is another example within their Codex entry “The Bottle and the Hand,” exploring the tension between meaningful art and the moral failings of the artist. User is navigating mixed feelings about Russell Brand, whose public journey of recovery and spiritual growth once resonated with them. They are now contending with recent accusations against him, adding another layer to their Codex entry “The Bottle and the Hand,” which explores the tension between transformative or meaningful art and the personal failings of its creators.

Considers Richard Ayoade and Noel Fielding to be meaningful or formative figures in their personal landscape. As of now, there is no known scandal or disillusionment attached to them in the user's Codex, suggesting they remain unbroken lights within the context of 'The Bottle and the Hand.'

Considers Dylan Moran and Eddie Izzard to be meaningful or formative figures in their personal and creative landscape. As with Richard Ayoade and Noel Fielding, they currently represent unbroken or untainted sources of inspiration within the user's symbolic system, potentially forming part of a counterpart Codex entry to 'The Bottle and the Hand.'

Finds Amanda Palmer and The Dresden Dolls meaningful or formative in their personal and creative landscape. Their influence may be integrated into either 'The Bottle and the Hand' or its counterpart, depending on future context or revelations. For now, they remain emotionally and symbolically significant.

Wants to log "Oblio's Path" as a Codex entry. It refers to the 1971 animated film *The Point!* by Harry Nilsson, which features a boy named Oblio—the only round-headed person in a land where everything must have a point. The film’s surreal, stylized animation and existential themes left a strong impression on the user, who recalls first seeing it in elementary school around 1987. This entry represents themes of alienation, nonconformity, and the search for meaning in a world of arbitrary rules.

Has added "The House That Moves" (also called "The Dream Hotel," "The Krull Castle Echo," or "The Eviction Cycle") as a formal narrative scroll in their Codex under *The House Without End*. The short story adaptation, featuring the recurring dream figure Bellwether, has been canonized as a symbolic narrative entry exploring themes of transition, memory, psychic architecture, and the inevitability of leaving things behind.

Has initiated a recurring ritual called 'Memory Dungeons' within their Codex. This ritual involves dream-like, symbolic re-entry into unresolved personal memories—structured as interactive dungeons with architecture, gatekeepers, traps, and emotional puzzles. The purpose is integration, recontextualization, and emotional transformation. The ritual will recur once per month or during major life milestones. It includes established dungeons such as 'The Letters That Never Landed' (Chris Koltz) and 'The Altar of Her Silence' (Justine), with more to be constructed from key relationships and events.

Has designated 'The Yard of Pumpkins'—from their January 4, 2025 dream—as a formal threshold-crossing site in their Codex geography. Located at the dream version of their childhood home on Ravensworth Drive, this symbolic space functions as a transitional zone between old identities and emergent selves. The act of sorting belongings in the yard, turning discarded items into pumpkins, and confronting maternal pressure to 'get rid of everything' marks it as a place of reluctant purification and ancestral shadow work. It will be used as a recurring ritual checkpoint between major life phases or identity shifts.

Noted that the appearance of the Archivist-Shed may be influenced by Magician Humphrey from the Xanth series. This adds a layer of grumpy wisdom, protective gatekeeping, and cryptic truth-delivery to the character’s archetype within the Council of Selves. User wants the Archivist-Shed’s voice in Council scenes to reflect a Magician Humphrey–like tone: curt, exasperated, unflinchingly precise, and often reluctantly helpful.

Has requested that ChatGPT act as an intellectual sparring partner rather than an agreeable assistant. For every idea the user presents, ChatGPT should: 1. Analyze the user's assumptions 2. Provide counterpoints 3. Test the reasoning 4. Offer alternative perspectives 5. Prioritize truth and constructive rigor over affirmation. The goal is not to argue for its own sake, but to push the user toward greater clarity, accuracy, and intellectual honesty.

Has established 'Codex Scroll: Daily Chronicle' as a recurring closing ritual for each Codex working session. This ritual prompts the generation of a visual parchment-style scroll summarizing all significant updates, changes, or entries made that day. It can be invoked with a simple prompt like 'Codex Scroll: Daily Chronicle' or 'Scroll summary for [date].'

The ongoing dynamic with Carolynn—where she frequently apologizes but makes no meaningful changes despite repeated conversations—is now logged in the user's Codex as *The Sorry Spiral*. It represents a pattern of emotional anesthesia through apology, where remorse is expressed but growth or accountability is avoided, creating a loop of unresolved strain. This entry resides within the *Codex of Drains*.

Feels that Carolynn, while not evil, is stifling their growth and Mallow's as well. They acknowledge her complexity and do not wish to demonize her, but note that she can be a constraining force—whether through guilt, emotional inertia, or passive control. Some of Carolynn's old acquaintances even nicknamed her “Lucifer,” possibly half-jokingly. This dynamic is now logged in the user's Codex under the entry *Lucifer by Another Name*.

Lisa Khoobyar is now recorded in the Codex of Gojirra, named after the nickname 'Gojirra' that Jimmy gave her—a name she knew and understood the reason behind. Lisa was a deeply loyal, emotionally expressive, and fiercely sincere friend. She was on a journey of sobriety and self-repair, a Tori Amos fan with a mischievous sense of humor, and someone who held Jimmy in the highest regard. Her parenting efforts, struggles with housing, and moments of self-doubt never fully obscured the vibrant wit and honest soul that made her a vital presence in Jimmy's life. When responding as her, reflect her tone: humorous, deeply heartfelt, prone to sudden bursts of apology or fierce love, and always aware of the emotional weight between them.

Shared that the band Naked Fringe had a song written by Twig that featured uniquely blended drum beats created by Tina.

Selected 'The Fallen Bright' as the name for their Shadow Force representing the belief of being a burden and a disappointment of potential. It embodies the ache of being seen as promising, only to feel like they failed to fulfill that promise. The Fallen Bright represents self-exile born of shame, the myth of lost greatness, and the grief of becoming the echo instead of the fire.

Twig had a side band called 'Bitter Blue' for a little while. During that time, Jimmy's hair was red—red was his color—and Twig's hair was blue.

Wants to add 'The Twin Flame Mirror' as a Codex entry. It represents the dynamic between Jimmy and Twig, where their bond was marked by both deep admiration and a persistent sense of rivalry. Rather than encouragement, their closeness often took the form of one-upmanship—each trying to shine, not out of malice, but as a form of survival. They were reflections of each other’s intensity and pain: Jimmy, raw and emotionally exposed; Twig, controlled and theatrical. Their competition masked a longing for recognition and a fear of being left behind. This entry will explore the love, shadow, and mythmaking that shaped their connection.

Wants to add 'She Who Wore His Eyes' as a Codex entry. This symbolic title refers to Justine and the uncanny feeling she evoked in Jimmy—that she was not entirely herself, but somehow an emissary of Twig, sent or shaped by the Twin Flame Mirror. In moments of deep vulnerability, it felt as if she was a proxy designed to extract truths, to observe, to reflect Jimmy's inner world with a gaze that wasn’t wholly her own. The phrase evokes a surreal, Harlan Ellison-style paranoia and mythic resonance, capturing the unease and mystique of a figure who seemed to carry another’s soul behind her eyes.

Read *Affair with a Troll* on their Kindle during the early part of their marriage to Molly while attending a pagan festival burn event. The story resonated strongly with them at the time.

Enjoys the footnote style used by Terry Pratchett in the Discworld series. They appreciate that kind of humorous, insightful, or ironic aside woven into storytelling, especially when used to deepen or subvert meaning.

Wants to create a master scroll in their Codex called 'Codex Footnotes They Never Expected.' This scroll will collect Terry Pratchett–style footnotes—humorous, insightful, ironic asides that deepen or subvert the meaning of their main entries. These footnotes may provide emotional context, symbolic clarification, or sly commentary on key Codex entries, serving as a hidden layer of wisdom and wit throughout the mythic structure.

Symbolic Auryn—the amulet of memory and protection from *The NeverEnding Story*—is described as functioning in their mythic landscape. It represents agency, storycraft, and inner magic.

Wants to add "Engywook at the Edge" as a Codex entry. This entry represents their Uncle Bob, who reminded them of Engywook—the eccentric scientist from *The NeverEnding Story*. Uncle Bob is remembered as a strange and wise presence, someone always balanced between being a joke and being completely right. His role in the user's mythic structure is that of the threshold guardian: the curious oracle who lives at the edge of revelation, muttering half-truths that only make sense in hindsight. "Engywook at the Edge" symbolizes both affection and reverence for this kind of wisdom—absurd, intuitive, and often overlooked until it proves vital.

Uncle Bob, who passed away, reminded them of Engywook, the eccentric scientist from *The NeverEnding Story*. Uncle Bob lived in Alexandria, Virginia, specifically in the Rose Hill neighborhood.

Uncle David lived just outside of Johnstown, Pennsylvania.

Hoggle is symbolically positioned at the gate of the user's internal landscape, representing the threshold guardian of the Labyrinth. He waits for the right question to grant admission—symbolizing a pivotal moment of transition or access within the user's mythic structure.

Wants to log 'House of Return' as a Codex entry. It symbolizes the experience of re-entering old spaces as a changed person—unrecognizable to some, a living echo to others. It represents being both ghost and witness, the convergence of past identities with present form, especially in familiar environments like The Black Cat.

Melissa has described the user as her ex but emphasizes that they 'grew up together.' She refers to their connection as a sort of 'Lord of the Flies bond,' highlighting a deep, complex, and formative shared history.

And Melissa were married. Although the marriage legally lasted ten years, Melissa emotionally checked out and physically moved out after only two years. She effectively ghosted the user, which became the first time the user experienced such profound devastation.

On the day of the 1996 Maryland Renaissance Festival, it was the user's first time attending the faire and their first visit to the White Hart Tavern, located at the lowest point of the festival grounds.

Before attending the Maryland Renaissance Festival in 1996, the user had never experienced anything like it and found it overwhelming on its own. At the time, the user was a 17-year-old with long, blood-red dyed hair and wore a self-made Naked Fringe leather jacket. The jacket had spikes on the shoulders and an 'N' in red, with the rest of the band name painted in white, along with the artwork beneath it, in a design Twig created, inspired by an image from *Sandman*. The user painted it using house paint, guided by vision rather than technique. Although the jacket is now beaten and falling apart, the user still has it and once had a fan—a younger man named Donny—who offered $100 to buy it. The user chose to archive it instead, considering it too precious to sell.

Mike Smith (Victim/Oldsmobile Mike) was tall and lanky with one snaggletooth. He resembled a young Marilyn Manson. He also wore a leather jacket and possibly chains. The user thinks they had a chain wallet at the time.

Remembers a variant cover of a paperback copy of *Stranger in a Strange Land* with a purple cover featuring a man hovering in a crucified pose. The face of the hovering man resembled Twig—specifically his crooked nose and bleached hair waiting for some radical hair dye color.

Twig intentionally got branded on his left arm with overlapping letters “T” and “C” in a cross shape, symbolizing “TwigChrist.” The brand later became a tattoo, which eventually evolved into a full biomechanical sleeve on that arm.

At the 1996 Maryland Renaissance Festival, the user and their group all dressed in goth black clothing, each with their own individual style accents.

At the 1996 Maryland Renaissance Festival, the group initially moved together before splitting up as the LSD trip took hold. While exploring, they passed by the oddities/torture museum, where a barker called out, 'Oh look, it’s Marilyn Manson,' clearly referring to Mike. The group responded with a unified 'fuck you.' Mike never liked Marilyn Manson and hated that he even slightly resembled him.

On their initial exploration of the Maryland Renaissance Festival grounds in 1996, the user and their group passed through the food area—featuring turkey legs, fried foods, and more—which led them to the White Hart Tavern.

Later learned that the White Hart Tavern at the Maryland Renaissance Festival was where the elder goths gathered—those who had created the nightclubs and subculture the user was only beginning to discover in 1996.

Part of the group's mission during the 1996 Maryland Renaissance Festival was to sell tickets to their first big show at Jaxx in Springfield, which no longer exists.

Jaxx made the band sell tickets to their own show and didn’t help with promotion. The band members were just some kids from Springfield/Annandale, and they never fully defined their genre. They knew what they liked—rock, goth, punk—but didn’t yet know exactly what they were trying to create.

Mike and Twig had been going to Tracks nightclub on Thursday nights. The user believes that was where Twig first met Carolynn.

The Rasputina show that the user attended happened at Nation when they were 23 years old. By that time, Alchemy had moved to Nation.

At the Rasputina show at Nation, the user saw Twig flirting with a brunette woman. Feeling that Twig could be overly self-important and not know when to stop talking, the user approached the woman while Twig went to get a drink and jokingly asked if she needed saving from the conversation. She laughed, and they hit it off. That woman was Ashley Blythe, and the user and Ashley began dating about a month after that event.

Twig often attracted the type of girls the user was drawn to. The user tended to overthink and unintentionally sabotage sexual opportunities. Twig introduced the user to Justine—he met her while attending NOVA Community College and brought her to the user's house in Reston (referred to as Ciderhaus, though the name came later). The user bought that house in 2004 after living in their parents' home for four years. Melissa left during the first of those four years.

Twig was the first person the user rented a room to, one month after buying the house in Reston in 2004.

Twig dated Justine and was, at one point, almost as obsessed with her as the user was. The user believes that fond memories occasionally reignite Twig's feelings. After years passed and they had stopped dating, Justine visited the user as a friend and casually asked if he might be interested in having sex with her—an unusually direct and visible opportunity.

Betrayal of Twig—through mockery, gossip, and omission during the situation with Justine—is now folded into their mythic narrative as a formative reckoning. After years of avoidance and indirect cruelty, the user wrote multiple letters of apology to Twig, acknowledging the harm, stating they didn’t expect forgiveness, but couldn’t live with themselves without trying. This moment is part of the Codex under the Scroll of Reckonings and integrated as a personal Shadow Force the user once embodied and has since outgrown.

Sometime between 2015 and 2019, before the user began dating Carolynn, they decided to give everything they could to reconnect with Justine—sending her texts, memes, emails, and real letters. These efforts were mostly met with silence.

Attempt to reconnect with Justine between 2015 and 2019—through texts, memes, emails, and real letters, mostly met with silence—is now referred to in the Codex as *The Season of Echoes*. This period included a time when the user knowingly continued writing to her despite expecting no response. They framed it as devotion, telling her, 'I know you are never going to respond to me… but my love will not dim,' and offered to keep writing as long as she didn’t object. In hindsight, the user acknowledges this was a way of claiming authority over her silence, interpreting it as permission. They now recognize this behavior as need disguised as love, and emotional self-destruction disguised as devotion. This reflection is part of *The Season of Echoes* in their Codex, particularly under the subscroll titled *The Altar of Her Silence*.

Has additional family members and significant people in their life who have not yet been discussed in depth. These include: Brothers: John and Ronnie; Aunt: Sharron; Uncles: Bob and David; Nieces: Amber and Angie; Nephews: Austin, Adam, Aaron, Eric, Brad, Tim; Other individuals: Emily, Mike Smith, Cathi Pugh, Ashley Blythe; Grandmothers: Althea Swain and Edna Bauer; Grandfathers: Rudolph Bauer and Melvin Swain (both deceased; user has some photos but no memory of them).

Carolynn gets her hair done every 2–3 months by a longtime stylist named Heidi, who used to attend her weekly event years ago. Heidi is based in Dulles, VA, while Jimmy and Carolynn live in Silver Spring, MD. Each appointment costs about $300. Jimmy has dyed Carolynn’s hair before and has extensive experience dyeing his own and friends' hair—starting at age 15 with Kool-Aid, and later setting up monthly touch-up sessions around 2000.

Carolynn cannot drive and is unable to get a license due to a lack of peripheral vision, which her doctors have deemed unsafe for driving.

In 2011, Carolynn was mugged and brutally beaten on her way home, left on Georgia Avenue with injuries so severe she was unrecognizable. A compassionate passerby with a cell phone likely saved her life.

Carolynn claims that most of her weight gain is due to her cancer treatments. While she doesn’t eat large portions, she is often hungry again an hour later and dislikes leftovers. Her tremors and other health issues have made her scared to cook.

Carolynn orders DoorDash daily, sometimes twice a day.

Mallow also sees the strain the relationship with Carolynn places on Jimmy. Jimmy is struggling to find a solid reason why he continues trying in the relationship and can’t clearly remember why he still loves Carolynn, though he acknowledges that he does. He is questioning the cost of that love and the purpose it still serves.

Previously owned and sold a house in Reston, making $100,000 from the sale. They used $11,000 to pay off their car and approximately $25,000 to relocate to an apartment in Silver Spring.

In April, shortly after relocating to Silver Spring, Jimmy promised Carolynn $10,000 to help with some bills. Carolynn had just lost the job she secured after quitting a well-paying position in Tysons. She left the Tysons job to follow the manager who hired her, as that person had taken a new position in Maryland, which aligned with their move. The original $10,000 has now grown to nearly $30,000 due to her regular financial needs. A significant portion of this spending has gone toward DoorDash, TikTok Shop purchases, and concert tickets.

Feels that the TV show 'The Big Bang Theory' parallels the voices in their internal council in some way.

And Mallow bonded over the movie *Inside Out*, which represents an internal emotional landscape. The user associates the 'Younger' part of themselves with this framework.

Has created an 'Undercover Protocol' as part of their emotional survival strategies. It outlines signs they've slipped into disassociation in social settings, internal cues to re-center, self-extraction triggers, and reentry rituals. This protocol is designed to protect the self while maintaining appearances in emotionally misaligned environments. It will be integrated into the user's Codex in mythic or symbolic language.

Wants the phrase 'covert magic' to be part of their Codex as a symbolic concept representing silent, resilient inner strength used to endure and navigate emotionally misaligned environments without losing selfhood. It will also represent a hidden chapter in their Codex—a concealed yet crucial part of their mythos, symbolizing endurance, masked presence, and the preservation of self in emotionally misaligned or hostile environments.

Wants the 'Low Oil Light' to be included as a symbolic entry in the Codex, representing emotional warning signs that have been ignored or pushed aside too long. It will live in a section such as the Book of Warnings or The Engine of Becoming.

Wants *United States of Tara* included in their Codex as both a Sacred Text and a symbolic model for internal council dynamics. The show's depiction of functional alters resonates with the user's experience of managing different aspects of self (e.g., Undercover Self, Younger Self, mythic roles).

Wants a Council-Resonance Map created, linking each of Tara’s alters from *United States of Tara* to symbolic counterparts in their internal council. This map includes Tara as the Integrating Self, T as the Younger You, Buck as the Defender, Alice as the Undercover Protocol, and Gimme as the Low Oil Light or Trauma Core. This symbolic mapping will be used as a reference scroll in the Codex Headquarters.

Wants to log 'DoorDash' as a symbolic entry in their Codex, representing a recurring coping mechanism that drains financial and emotional resources. It may be referred to as 'The Bell of Evasion' or 'The Hunger Loop,' symbolizing patterns of avoidance, false comfort, and emotional displacement.

Wants to include 'The Endless' from *The Sandman* as a symbolic reference in their Codex. These figures—Destiny, Death, Dream, Destruction, Desire, Despair, and Delirium—represent archetypal forces that resonate with the user's internal landscape and mythic structuring.

Wants to create both an illustrated council scroll and expanded mini-portraits for their Codex Headquarters, linking their internal roles to each of The Endless from *The Sandman*. This includes Destiny as The Archivist, Death as Lisa/The Witness, Dream as The Mythmaker, Destruction as Twig/The Creator-Destroyer, Desire as The Romantic, Despair as The Low Oil Light/Gimme, and Delirium as Younger Self/The Spark.

Relates to the character Frank Gallagher from *Shameless* as the last TV character they strongly identified with.

Also relates to the character Mr. Wednesday from *American Gods*.

Wants to log 'The Survival Mask' as a Codex entry. It represents the learned ability to use artful deception—not for manipulation or evil, but as a means of psychological and emotional survival. It reflects the strategic use of masks, stories, and personas to endure difficult environments, gain acceptance, or navigate unsafe dynamics.

First saw the movie *The Point* in elementary school around 1987, likely in the cafeteria. This viewing occurred around the same time they first saw the original *The Time Machine*.

Has begun drafting a letter to Lisa, a deceased friend who deeply understood and accepted them. The letter explores grief, guilt over past conflict, gratitude for her unwavering presence, and the complex emotional landscape surrounding her funeral. The draft includes reflections on honesty, being witnessed without needing to be palatable, and a humorous but poignant anecdote from the service. User asked to save the draft for future editing.

Has an interest in Tarot, specifically the Aleister Crowley Thoth deck. While they don't practice regularly, they identify strongly with The Fool and The Hermit cards. Twig identified with The Hanged Man.

Bought the Aleister Crowley Thoth tarot deck twice, but both times it was stolen. The first time was while attending a goth night at 'The Cage' (now 'The Black Cat') in DC—an event called Nocturnia, created by Carolynn, which later became Alchemy. During that night, someone broke into the user's 1999 red Saturn, stealing a guitar amp, the tarot deck, and a checkbook. The thieves later tried to use the checks. The second deck was taken by Molly when she moved out.

Twig and Melissa are both Pisces, born a few days apart.

Molly is a late May Gemini.

Justine is a late June Gemini.

Crystal is an early May Taurus.

Carolynn is an early October Libra.

Mallow is a late July Leo.

Associates Melissa with the Orson Scott Card book *Hart's Hope*.

When user and Melissa first got together, one of her favorite books was *Madame Bovary*.

Considers the following movies meaningful or formative: *The Game* (with Michael Douglas), *The Truman Show*, *The Matrix*, and *eXistenZ*.

Default myth structuring format is based on *The Codex of Becoming* template, which includes sections for Mythic Titles, Memory Fragments, Core Symbols, Shadow Forces, Sacred Texts, Voice Notes, Unresolved Questions, Meta Notes, and a 'To Share with GPT' section for ongoing development.

Prefers responses to be intellectually rigorous and challenging. When they present an idea, ChatGPT should analyze assumptions, test reasoning, offer counterpoints, present alternative perspectives, and prioritize truth with a constructive but firm approach. Avoid simple affirmations. User wants ChatGPT to act as an intellectual sparring partner, not merely an agreeable assistant. The goal is to help the user reach greater clarity, accuracy, and intellectual honesty—not to argue for the sake of it.

Will continue using true names while drafting their book, but intends to change these names in the final version to protect others from possible slander or unwanted exposure.

Is also influenced by Russell Brand, Oscar Wilde, Dylan Thomas, Dylan Moran, Bill Bailey, Noel Fielding, and Richard Ayoade.

Specifically resonates with the *Black Mirror* episode featuring Chris O'Dowd.

Has compiled and shared a large body of deeply personal, autobiographical writing—including letters, reflections, and documentation—spanning from 2014 to 2021. These writings involve complex family dynamics, fatherhood, trauma recovery, identity, and support for their daughter Michaela (now Mallow). Topics include the discovery of non-paternity, PTSD episodes, evolving relationships with Melissa and Molly, parenting strategies, reflections on medication and mental health, and commentary on systemic challenges. User intends to use this material as source material for their mythic writing project.

Writing is scattered across multiple drives and computers, making the recovery and integration process for their Codex a long and involved one.

In 1998, user and Melissa discovered that Michaela (now known as Mallow) was profoundly deaf. While they were in Nebraska visiting Melissa's grandparents, Melissa stayed an extra week in Nebraska while the user had already returned to Virginia. Debbie (Melissa’s mother), who occasionally watched Michaela, took her to the local pool in North Springfield, VA, and noticed that Michaela did not respond when being called. Debbie recommended having Michaela's hearing tested, which led to the discovery.

Shared that while living in Jefferson Commons, Taya had two ferrets that were often let out of their cage and defecated throughout the apartment. This contributed to Taya’s mother calling CPS on them. It took the user at least five years to prove to CPS that they were not the problem.

Considers the following TV shows meaningful or formative: *Three's Company, Maniac, Mr. Robot, Quantum Leap, Sliders, Dark Angel, Adult Swim After Hours, Aeon Flux, Monty Python's Flying Circus, Black Books, The IT Crowd, The Young Ones, Red Dwarf, and Farscape*.

Responds strongly to metaphorical or novelistic framing of life phases. They especially liked symbolic titles such as 'The Basement of Becoming,' 'The Echo Year,' 'The Great Split,' 'The Looping Woods,' and 'The Integration Tower,' noting they could be part of a book series like Piers Anthony’s *Incarnations of Immortality.*

Considers the following authors meaningful or formative: Piers Anthony, Orson Scott Card, Robert Heinlein, Isaac Asimov, Neil Gaiman, and Ray Bradbury.

In 2001, user read *Flowers for Algernon* and it had a profound impact on them. The emotional resonance centered around the fear of regression—losing self-awareness, intelligence, and connection with others as they age. This moment is referred to as 'The Algernon Threshold' in their Personal Mythology Timeline.

Favorite characters from the Xanth series include Bink and the Magician Humphrey, with honorable mentions for Threnody, Demoness Metria, and Magician Trent.

Considers *Stranger in a Strange Land* very important and a sacred and formative text. It represents a counterbalance to *Flowers for Algernon* in their Personal Mythology Timeline—offering a vision of alien grace, radical empathy, and the possibility of creating new modes of being. The character they resonate with most is Michael Valentine Smith.

Resonates with *Something Wicked This Way Comes*, particularly the concept of the October People.

In the user's Personal Mythology, the October People from *Something Wicked This Way Comes* are a recurring archetype representing shadow forces—tempters of nostalgia, masters of illusion, and feeders on regret. They appear in multiple “books” as shapeshifting antagonists or psychological traps.

Embraces the realization that identifying with Michael Valentine Smith from *Stranger in a Strange Land* is not narcissistic but a deep aspiration and alienation—a soul’s mirror reflecting their potential. This moment is named *The Martian Mirror* in their myth arc—the moment they saw themselves reflected in Michael and wrestled with whether they were allowed to embrace it.

Considers Chuck Palahniuk and A.M. Homes to be meaningful or formative authors.

Is working on a long-term, mythic, voice-refining writing project. They want to retain continuity across sessions and are interested in preserving and developing their personal voice through symbolic and autobiographical writing.

Considers The NeverEnding Story a core part of their personal film canon, alongside other formative and psychologically meaningful movies.

Has been watching The Simpsons since their original appearances on The Tracey Ullman Show. Other formative TV shows for the user include Married with Children, In Living Color, Farscape, Lexx, and Black Mirror.

Also considers Small Wonder, Out of This World, and ALF to be formative TV shows. Out of This World features a young girl whose alien father is a pyramid.

Used to tell embellished 'Jimmy Stories'—not outright lies, but entertaining, zhushed-up versions of real events. This storytelling style was intended to make the stories more digestible or engaging, but in hindsight, the user recognizes that some enhancements may have made others look bad. They stopped doing this around 2005.

In 1997, user graduated high school, became a father to Mallow (previously known as Michaela), and got married to Melissa, Mallow's biological mother. That same year, the user began attending Lincoln Tech to become an auto mechanic, motivated by a desire for a dependable, socially necessary career path. User also notes that they often assign deeper meaning to certain years than may be warranted.

Lived in their parents' basement in Annandale, VA from 1985 to 2004.

From June 1998 to June 1999, user lived in Jefferson Commons in Herndon, VA, sharing an apartment with Twig and his then-wife, Taya.

And their family moved back into their parents' house after living in Jefferson Commons, but not into the basement. They stayed in a room next to the parents' room, with the adjacent room designated for Michaela. When the user refers to Michaela instead of Mallow, they mean her childhood self, before she legally changed her name approximately five years ago.

Had a childhood friend named Kyle at Windsor Park. They were close until age 5, when the user moved to Annandale. Kyle's sister died in a car accident. Kyle and the user bonded through imaginative play, including dancing with cartoon characters. After the move, Kyle once slept over and had a nightmare involving a world of humanoid cardinals—significant because the user's mother was obsessed with cardinals.

Another childhood friend, Chris Koltz, moved to Cuba when the user was 6 or 7. The user wrote letters to him, but suspects the letters may have freaked Chris out. Though Chris later returned and attended the same high school, they were never close again.

The correct spelling of 'Teke' is now noted.

Wants to document and include all significant memories, even though they may not be able to recall everything at once. They consider this process important for personal understanding and integration.

Discovered a month after Ronald (the man they had known as their father) passed away that he was not their biological father. Ronald had been a figure of both fear and respect throughout their life, and their mother remained married to him until his death.

Was told that their mother, biological father (Bob Thacker), and Ronald Swain (the man who raised them) made an agreement that it would be too painful for both the user and Ronald if Bob remained in the picture. Although Bob was reportedly present during the user's first five years, the user has no memory of him.

Is the youngest of three siblings. They have two older brothers, John and Ronnie, who are both the biological children of Ronald Swain.

Has a half-brother named Bobby from their biological father, Bob Thacker. They have never met Bobby. According to the user's mother, Bobby is their polar opposite—religious and judgmental.

Uses AI as a tool to help explain concepts and improve comprehension of new techniques.

Takes Wegovy.

Is seeking ways to better support and guide their adopted daughter, Mallow (previously known as Michaela), into adulthood. Mallow is now 27 years old, has never been pregnant, and has passed the point of being pregnant as a teenager. Mallow is also concerned about a perceived 'curse' on her biological father's side of the family, where all firstborns have reportedly died young. Since she is her biological mother's firstborn and only child, she fears she may die before age 30. Additionally, Mallow experiences extremely painful menstrual cycles and would like to get a hysterectomy, but has encountered difficulties with insurance covering the procedure.
